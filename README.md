## How to add a ballot or staking event as a node operator?

These steps are identical for Shimmer and IOTA Hornet Nodes.

### Add event via node dashboard

After starting your node, you can open the node dashboard and navigate to `Plugins`.<br>
If the Participation plugin has been successfully enabled, you should see a new option called `Participation`.
